# Clicky Game

## Overview

This is a memory game with React. 

### How it works

* To start the game, just click on an image of a dog. The grid will be shuffed. 
* Try to click on every dog. Once you click on an image, your score will increase by 1.
* You will win the game when you reach a score of 15. However, you can only get it if each dog is being click once. 
* If you click twice on the same dog, you will lose the game and your score will be reset back to "zero".

Enjoy!
